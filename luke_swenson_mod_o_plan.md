# Gameplan for success

This is my game plan for success for MOD 0 at Turing and how I will get through the course successfully

1. **Plan out my days**
  * Time management is extremely important when trying to complete this course as MOD 0 requires homework, study/review, and a 35 hour long project. Using my calendar and chunking time will be vital to success.
2. ***Review, Review, and Review!***
  * Review all the lessons and make sure to complete all homework. Practice code on my off time and make sure I have a good understanding on what we went over the previous session
3. **FOCUS**
   * Making sure I come to the MOD 0 sessions with intentions to learn and grow.

## Learn and have fun
Either though this is all new to me, the most important thing about MOD 0 is just having fun with what Im learning. Learning *git*, *atom*, *slack*, and many more programs could be information overload, but taking it one day at a time and ingesting the knowledge to my pace will help me.

## Learning commands
There are many commands I have learned already and many more to come, learning these will be the foundation of when I will start my MOD 1 classes

```
mkdir
touch
ls
cd
pwd
clear
rm
```
I have not started learning ruby yet but heres my attempt at inline code block for it.
```ruby
def salute
```

This is my gameplan and following this will help me succeed in MOD 0

 In the end, i will be just fine...
